The repository contains two main folders corresponding to sections in the paper:

* **[Causal Discovery](https://github.com/AnaRitaNogueira/Methods-and-Tools-for-Causal-Discovery-and-Causal-Inference/tree/main/3.%20Causal%20Discovery)**;
* **[Causal Estimation](https://github.com/AnaRitaNogueira/Methods-and-Tools-for-Causal-Discovery-and-Causal-Inference/tree/main/4.%20Causal%20Estimation)**.

Each of these folders contains a list of files to reproduce the examples in the paper and a list of tools for practitioners.
Each tool is linked to its original documentation in order to have a practical and updated toolkit for different causal tasks.
