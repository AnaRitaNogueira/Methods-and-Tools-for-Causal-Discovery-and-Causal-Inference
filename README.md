# Methods and Tools for Causal Discovery and Causal Inference
By Ana Rita Nogueira, Andrea Pugnana, Salvatore Ruggieri, Dino Pedreschi and Joao Gama.

## Introduction

This page is used as a support for the paper "Methods and Tools for Causal Discovery and Causal Inference".

The repository contains two main folders:

* **[Causal Discovery](https://github.com/AnaRitaNogueira/Methods-and-Tools-for-Causal-Discovery-and-Causal-Inference/tree/main/3.%20Causal%20Discovery)**;
* **[Causal Estimation](https://github.com/AnaRitaNogueira/Methods-and-Tools-for-Causal-Discovery-and-Causal-Inference/tree/main/4.%20Causal%20Estimation)**.

Each of these folders contains a list of files to reproduce the examples in the paper and a list of tools for practitioners.
Each tool is linked to its original documentation in order to have a practical and updated toolkit for different causal tasks.

## Causal Discovery
The first folder contains examples for section 3 of the paper. The examples are divided according to the kind of data: we have provided examples for both cross-sectional data techniques and scripts for dealing with causal discovery for time-series. Different software packages were tested in order to check different methods.
