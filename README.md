# Methods and Tools for Causal Discovery and Causal Inference
This page is used as a support for the paper "Methods and Tools for Causal Discovery and Causal Inference".

The repository contains two main folders:

* **[Causal Discovery](https://github.com/AnaRitaNogueira/Methods-and-Tools-for-Causal-Discovery-and-Causal-Inference/tree/main/3.%20Causal%20Discovery)**
* **[Causal Estimation](https://github.com/AnaRitaNogueira/Methods-and-Tools-for-Causal-Discovery-and-Causal-Inference/tree/main/4.%20Causal%20Estimation)**

## Causal Discovery
The first folder contains examples for section 3 of the paper. The examples are divided according to the kind of data: we have provided examples for both cross-sectional data techniques and scripts for dealing with causal discovery for time-series.

## Causal Estimation
The second folder contains the R scripts for the example in section 5.4. CSV files with results for each run are also provided.
